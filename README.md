An Obsidian plugin that integrates Claude Code CLI to provide AI assistance directly within your note-taking workflow. Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Features

### 🆕 v0.6.0 - Selection-Based Workflow
- **Instant execution**: Select text and run Claude without modal dialogs
- **Selection replacement**: Selected text becomes the question, response replaces selection
- **Dual operation modes**: Traditional modal input OR instant selection-based execution

### Core Features
- **Ask Claude about your notes**: Send your current note content along with a question to Claude
- **Cursor position insertion**: Claude's response is automatically inserted at your cursor position (when no selection)
- **Selection replacement**: Replace selected text with Claude's response (when text is selected)
- **Comprehensive logging**: Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Progress tracking**: Verbose mode shows Claude's thinking process
- **Debug tools**: Built-in testing and debugging capabilities

## Usage

#### ⚡ Instant Mode (With Selection) - v0.6.0
1. **Select text** you want Claude to process/improve
2. Press `Cmd/Ctrl + P` and search for "Ask Claude about current note" (or use ribbon icon)  
3. **No modal appears** - execution starts immediately
